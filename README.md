Hello, I'm [Vishruth N](https://github.com/Vishruth-N), an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay. I'm passionate about problem-solving and data analysis, and I love to see how my work can influence decisions and contribute to the success of projects.

In addition to my studies, I've been working on several interesting projects. From modelling cricket matches as a Markov Decision Process to generating maps using deep learning, I'm always looking for challenging problems to solve.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories and don't hesitate to connect or contribute. I'm always open for collaboration and interesting project ideas.

- Play-cricket-using-MDP: A project where I modelled a cricket match as a Markov Decision Process.
- Map-Generation-using-Deep-learning: Using deep learning techniques to generate maps.
